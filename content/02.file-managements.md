# File Management

Managing files and directories is a fundamental skill when working with operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu Linux). Below is a concise list of commonly used file management commands to help you navigate, organize, and manipulate files and directories.

Before diving into the commands, it’s important to understand what a directory is. A directory is a container used to organize and store files or other directories (called subdirectories).

> [!NOTE]
> All directories and files are organized under the `/` root directory. Think of it as the starting point or "parent of all parents" in the directory tree.

Below is the hierarchy of my directories and files under the root directory.

### 1. Navigating Directories

- **`pwd`**: Display the current working directory.
  
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
  Example: Run the `pwd` command.
  ```bash
  pwd
  /home/noura
  ```
  Here, we are in the `noura` directory, which is why the output is `/home/noura` since it's the path we are currently working on.

  When working with files and directories, it’s important to understand the two types of paths used to locate them,

 - `Absolute Path`: A complete path starting from the root, e.g, `/home/noura/Documents`.

 - `Relative Path`: A path relative to the current working directory, e.g, `/Documents` when we are at the `noura` directory.
  
- **`cd`**: Change directory.

  ```bash
  cd path/to/directory   # Go to a specific directory
  cd ..                   # Move up one level (parent directory)
  cd -                    # Go back to the previous directory
  ```
  Example
  ```bash
   pwd
   /home/noura                 # Output of pwd in the 'noura' directory
   cd Documents                # Go to the Documents folder
   pwd
   /home/noura/Documents       # Output
   cd ..                       # Move up from Documents folder to noura
   pwd
   /home/noura                 # Output
   cd -                        # Return to the previous directory (Documents)
   pwd
  /home/noura/Documents       # Output
  ```
> [!NOTE]
> Each `..` represents moving up one level in the directory hierarchy.

### 2. Creating Files and Directories

- **`mkdir`**: Create a new directory.
  
  ```bash
  mkdir directory_name       # Create a directory
  ```
  
  Example: Create a new directory called `Image`in the `Documents` directory.
  
  ```bash
  cd /home/noura/Documents
  mkdir Image               # Create a directory called "Image"
  ```

  <!-- Image 2 -->

  
- **`touch`**: Create an empty file.
  
  ```bash
  touch filename
  ```
  
  Example: Create `file2.txt` in the `Image` directory.
   ```bash
   cd Image         # Enter the Image directory
   touch file2.txt  # Create an empty file
   ```

### 3. Listing Files and Directories

- **`ls`**: List files and directories in the current location.
  
  Example: Listing files in the `Image` directory.
    ```bash
     cd /home/noura/Documents/Image
     ls                              # Output is file2.txt
    ```
- For more information about the files and directories in the current location, you can use the option `-l`.
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
  Output example:
  ```
  total 1
  -rw-rw-r--  1 noura noura 0 Oct 15 10:00 file2.txt
  ```

  Linux supports various file types, where **the first character of the file permissions indicates the file type**.

  | **File Type** | **Description**                              | **Indicator** |
  |---------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
  | Regular File  | A standard file containing data (text, binary, etc.). | `- `
  | Directory     | A folder containing other files or directories. | `d`       |
  | Symbolic Link | A shortcut or reference to another file or directory. | `l`           | 
  | Special File  | Used for device access (e.g., block or character devices). | `b/c`         | 
  | Socket File   | A special file for inter-process communication. | `s`           | 
  | Named Pipe    | A file for data transfer between processes.   | `p`           | 


- **`stat`**: Get detailed information about a file.
   ```bash
    stat filename
   ```
  
   Example:
 
   Get the file2 information in the `Image` directory:
   ```
    stat file2.txt
   ```
   ```bash
     File: file2.txt
     Size: 0       Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096 regular empty file
   Device: 802h/2050d   Inode: 806760     Links: 1
   Access: (0664/ -rw-rw-r--)  Uid: ( 1000/ noura)  Gid: ( 1001/ noura)
   Access: 2025-10-15 10:00:00.000000000 +0000
   Modify: 2025-10-15 09:59:00.000000000 +0000
   Change: 2025-10-15 09:59:10.000000000 +0000
    Birth: 2025-10-15 09:59:10.000000000 +0000
   ```
   
**Fields in `stat` Output**
   - `Size`: The size of the file in bytes.
   - `Blocks`: The number of blocks allocated for the file.
   - `Links`: Number of hard links pointing to the file.
   - `Access`: Last time the file was read.
   - `Modify`: Last time the file content was modified.
   - `Change`: Last time metadata (e.g., permissions) was changed.


### 4. Copying Files and Directories
- **`cp`**: Copy files or directories.
  
  ```bash
  cp orignalfile.txt copyfile.txt                    # Copy old_file new_file  
  cp -r source_directory destination_directory       # Copy a directory
  ```
  Example:
  
  Copy file2.txt to file3.txt:
  ```bash
   cp file2.txt file3.txt 
   ```
  Copy `Image` directory to `Backup`:
  ```bash
  cp -r Documents/Image  Documents/Backup
  ```
  
> [!NOTE]
> This command recursively copies the Image directory and its contents into the Backup directory. If the Backup directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

### 5. Moving and Renaming Files
- **`mv`**: Move or rename files and directories.
  
  ```bash
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt          
  mv source destination
  ```
  Example:
  
  Rename `file2.txt` (current location Image) to `report.txt`:
  ```bash
   mv file2.txt report.txt  
  ```
  
### 6. Deleting Files and Directories
- **`rm`**: Remove files or directories.
  
  ```bash
  rm file.txt             # Delete a file
  rm -r directoryname/        # Delete a directory and its contents
  ```

### 7. Searching for Files
- **`find`**: Search for files and directories based on their name or other criteria.
  
  ```bash
  find /path -name "filename"   # Find a file with a specific name within the given path
  find /path -type d            # List only directories in the given path
  ```
  Example:
  
  ```bash
  find /home/noura/Documents -name "*.txt"      # Find all .txt files
  ```

### 8. Soft Links and Hard Links

#### **Soft Links (Symbolic Links)**
- A soft link is like a shortcut to another file or directory, and if the target file is deleted, the soft link becomes broken.

#### **Creating a Soft Link**
```bash
ln -s /path/to/target link_name
```

Example:

```bash
ln -s /home/noura/Documents/Image shortcut
ls -l
```
Output:
```bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 noura noura 27 Oct 19 10:30 shortcut -> /home/noura/Documents/Image
```

#### **Hard Links**
- A hard link points to the same inode as the original file. If the original file is deleted, the hard link remains intact.
  
#### **Creating a Hard Link**
```bash
ln /path/to/file link_name
```

Example:

```bash
ln file.txt link_to_file.txt
ls -l
```
Output:
```plaintext
-rw-r--r-- 2 noura noura 1024 Oct 19 10:00 file.txt
-rw-r--r-- 2 noura noura 1024 Oct 19 10:00 link_to_file.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
>  The "Links" column in the output (`2`) shows that both files share the same inode.
