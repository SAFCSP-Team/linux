# Network Management 
Network management is a critical skill for any computer specialist. Whether you want to analyze a network or interact with web servers, Linux provides a rich set of command-line tools for managing, analyzing, and troubleshooting network connectivity.

## Connectivity and Packet Analysis Commands
### 1. Network Connectivity
### `ping`
The `ping` command is used to check the connectivity and reachability of a host in the network. It operates by sending packets (ICMP echo packets) to a host and waits for a response (echo reply).

Example
```
ping google.com 
```

Expected output
```
PING google.com (172.217.171.238) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from wms90z07-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.171.238): icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=118 ms
64 bytes from wms90z07-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.171.238): icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=129 ms
64 bytes from wms90z07-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.171.238): icmp_seq=3 ttl=255 time=119 ms
64 bytes from wms90z07-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.171.238): icmp_seq=4 ttl=255 time=120 ms
64 bytes from wms90z07-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.171.238): icmp_seq=5 ttl=255 time=116 ms
```
The output indicates a successful connection to google.com. The most crucial data to extract from the output is the `time`, which represents the round-trip time taken for the packet to reach the destination and return. This value is important for assessing network latency and performance.

On most systems, ping sends packets continuously until interrupted (e.g., using `ctrl + c`). To specify a count, you can use the `-c` option.

Example 
```
ping -c 4 google.com
```

Output
```
PING google.com
56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from mad01525-in-f206.1e100.net (216.58.211.206): icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=82.3 ms

64 bytes from mad01525-in-f206.1e100.net (216.58.211.206): icmp_seq=4 ttl=255 time=20.8 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 82.330/115.573/137.392/20.830 ms
```

### 2. Tracing Network Paths
### `traceroute`
The `traceroute` is a command-line network diagnostic tool used to track the path packets take from your computer to a destination server or host.

Example
```
traceroute google.com
```
- This command prints each hop between your device and Googleâ€™s servers.

Expected output
```
traceroute to google.com (172.217.171.238), 64 hops max, 40 byte packets

> [!NOTE]
> `ip` replaces older commands like `ifconfige`.     
> `route` command has been largely replaced by the `ip route` command in modern Linux distributions, which is part of the `ip` suite. It is recommended to use `ip route` for
> new scripts or configurations.    
> `ss` command is a more modern and faster utility that provides similar functionality to `netstat`, but with additional features and better performance.

## Domain Name Server Commands
### What is the Domain Name System(DNS)?

It is the component of the internet standard protocol responsible for converting the human-friendly domain names likeÂ www.google.comÂ into IP addresses like 142.250.72.68 that computers use to communicate. This means that using either the IP address or the hostname in your web browser will generally result in retrieving the same web page, since both point to the same server.

Linux provides several commands to query DNS information and interact with web servers. Below are the most common commands and their usage.

 ### 1. DNS Lookup with `host`
The `host` command performs DNS lookups, translating domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.
```
host google.com
```
**Sample Output:**
```
google.com has address 142.250.75.78
google.com has IPv6 address 2a00:1450:4028:805::200e
google.com mail is handled by 10 smtp.google.com.
google.com has HTTP service bindings 1 . alpn="h2,h3"
````
- **Address**: Shows the IPv4 address for the domain.
- **IPv6 address**: Shows the IPv6 address if available.
- **Mail server (MX record)**: Indicates which server handles email for the domain.
- **HTTP service bindings**: Lists supported protocols (e.g., HTTP/2, HTTP/3).


**Reverse DNS Lookup (IP to Domain):**
```
host 142.250.75.78
```
**Sample Output:**
```
78.75.250.142.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer tztlva-ab-in-f14.1e100.net.
```
- **78.75.250.142.in-addr.arpa**: This is the reverse DNS query for the IP address.
- **domain name pointer tztlva-ab-in-f14.1e100.net**: This is the PTR (pointer) record, which maps the IP address back to a domain name.
- **1e100.net**: This domain is owned by Google, indicating its IP address is part of Googleâ€™s network.

> [!NOTE]
> Reverse DNS results for large companies like Google can change frequently. You may see different pointer records depending on your location and timing.

### 2. Name Server Lookup with `nslookup`
`nslookup` is a command-line tool used to query DNS servers for information about domains or IP addresses.
```
nslookup google.com
```
**Sample Output:**
```
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	google.com
Address: 142.250.75.110
Name:	google.com
Address: 2a00:1450:4028:800::200e

```
- **Server**: The DNS server your system is using.
- **Non-authoritative answer**: A valid DNS response, but not directly from the source server.
- **Name**: The domain queried.
- **Address**: The IP addresses returned for the domain (IPv4 and IPv6).


**Interactive Mode:**
```
nslookup
> set type=MX
> google.com
```
**Sample Output:**
```
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
google.com	mail exchanger = 10 smtp.google.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
smtp.google.com	internet address = 64.233.166.27
smtp.google.com	internet address = 64.233.167.26
smtp.google.com	internet address = 74.125.71.27
smtp.google.com	internet address = 64.233.166.26
smtp.google.com	internet address = 64.233.167.27
smtp.google.com	has AAAA address = 2a00:1450:400c:c09::1a
smtp.google.com	has AAAA address = 2a00:1450:400c:c0a::1b
smtp.google.com	has AAAA address = 2a00:1450:400c:c0a::1a
smtp.google.com	has AAAA address = 2a00:1450:400c:c09::1b
```
- **google.com  mail exchanger = 10 smtp.google.com.**: MX record is an email for google.com is handled by smtp.google.com, preference value 10.
- **Authoritative answers can be found from**: Lists the real IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) for the mail server smtp.google.com.

### 3. Detailed DNS Query with `dig`
The `dig` (Domain Information Groper) command provides detailed DNS query information.
```
dig google.com
```

**Sample Output:**
```
; <<>> DiG 9.20.11-1ubuntu2-Ubuntu <<>> google.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 44070
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; ENDS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 65494
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;google.com.      IN     A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com.   29   IN   A   142.250.201.14

;; Query time: 80 msec

- **OPT PSEUDOSECTION** displays advanced data:
  - **EDNS**: Extension system for DNS, if used.
  - **flags**: Specified flags. In this case, it's blank because no flags were specified.
  - **udp**: udp packet size.
- **QUESTION SECTION** displays the query data that was sent:
  - The first column is the domain name queried.
  - The second column is the query type (IN = Internet).
  - The third column specifies the record (A = Address) unless otherwise specified.
- **ANSWER SECTION** the most important section:
  - The first column lists the name of the server that was queried.
  - The second column is the Time to Live, a set timeframe after which the record is refreshed.
  - The third column is the query type (IN = Internet).
  - The fourth column specifies the record (A = Address).
  - The final column displays the IP address associated with the domain name.
- The **statistics section** shows metadata about the query:
  - **Query time**: The amount of time it took for a response.
  - **SERVER**: The responding DNS server IP address and port.
  - **WHEN**: The time when the command was run.
  - **MSG SIZE rcvd**: The size of the reply from the DNS server.
>[!TIP]
> You can specify the record type (e.g., MX for mail): `dig google.com MX`


**Find Only the Answer (just the IP address):**
```
dig +short google.com 
```
```

```
## Interacting with Web Servers
When you interact with a web server, you send and receive **HTTP messages**. Each message consists of two main parts: **headers** and **body**.
- **Headers** provide metadata about the requests or responses (e.g., content type, encoding, cookies).
- The **body** contains the main content (like the HTML of a page or the binary data of a file).

### HTTP Requests

An **HTTP request** is what your computer sends to a server to request a web page, submit form data, or perform another web action.

**Components of an HTTP Request:** 
- **HTTP Method**: The action to perform, such as `GET` to retrieve data, `POST` to send data, `PUT` to update data, `DELETE` to remove data.
- **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: The path or address of the resource on the server.
- **HTTP Version**: Indicates the version of the HTTP protocol (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
- **Request Headers:**: Additional information about the request, such as the user-agent, content type, cookies, and more.
- **Request Body (Optional)**: Data sent with the request, such as form fields or JSON (commonly used with `POST` or `PUT`).

### HTTP Responses

An **HTTP response** is what the server sends back after processing your request.

**Components of an HTTP Response:**
- **Status Line**: Includes the HTTP version, status code, and status message (e.g., HTTP/1.1 200 OK). The status code indicates whether the request was successful or if there was an error.
- **Response Headers**: Metadata about the response, such as content type, length, server details, and cookies.
- **Response Body(Data)**: The main content returned, such as HTML, images, JSON, or files.

### 1. Fetching Web Pages with `curl`
`curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data to or from a server, commonly used to fetch web pages or APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to install it first: `sudo apt install curl`

**Fetch a Webpage by Hostname**

To fetch the contents of a web page using its hostname:
```
curl https://www.google.com
```
- Displays the raw HTML returned by the server.

**Fetch a Webpage by IP Address**

You can also access a website by its IP address.

First, find the IP using a DNS command such as `host` or `dig`. Then use `curl` with the IP address and specify the Host header since many web servers host multiple sites.

```
curl http://142.250.201.14 -H "Host: www.google.com"
```
- The `-H` option sets the **Host** header, telling the server which website you want. If not set, you may get an error or a default page.
- This should return the same HTML output as using the hostname.

### 2. Checking HTTP Headers Only
To fetch just the HTTP headers (for debugging or information), use the `-I` option.
```
curl -I www.google.com
```
- Displays metadata about the response, including status code, headers, content type, content length, and  other server details.

### 3. Downloading Files with `curl`
You can use `curl` to download files, such as images, scripts, or documents.

**Download and Keep Original Filename**
```
curl -O http://www.google.com/image.png
```
 - The `-O` option saves the file with its original name.

**Download and Rename the File**
```
curl https://www.google.com -o google.html
```
- The `-o` option lets you specify the filename after the option.

### 4. Send Data to a Server
Websites often require users to submit data (e.g., for login forms). You can do this with `curl`.

**Send Data Directly**

Suppose a website expects two fields: username and password.
```
curl -d "username=myuser&password=mypass" https://example.com/login
```
- The `-d` option tells `curl` to send the provided string as data to the server.
- The string is formatted like a web form: field1=value1&field2=value2.

**Send Data from a File**

If you have a lot of data, you can write it in a file (e.g., data.txt) and send it like this:
```
curl -d @data.txt https://example.com/submit
```
- The `@` symbol tells `curl` to read the data from the specified file.



## Secure Shell
Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that enables a client device to securely connect to a server device. It is used for remote command-line access on a server.

```
ssh localshost # connect to your device (localhost)
ssh <username>@<hostname> # connect to another device (remote server)
```
> The `<hostname>` can be an IP address or the domain name of the remote server.
