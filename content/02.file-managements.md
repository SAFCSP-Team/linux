# File Management

Managing files and directories is a fundamental skill when working with operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu Linux). Below is a concise list of commonly used file management commands to help you navigate, organize, and manipulate files and directories.

Before diving into the commands, itâ€™s important to understand what a directory is. A directory is a container used to organize and store files or other directories (called subdirectories).

You can think of it like a folder in a filing system, where files act as documents stored within these folders for better organization.

### **Basic File Types**
Linux supports various file types. You can identify the type of a file using the `ls -l` command, where **the first character of the file permissions indicates the file type**.

| **File Type** | **Description**                              | **Indicator** |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Regular File  | A standard file containing data (text, binary, etc.). | `- `
| Directory     | A folder containing other files or directories. | `d`       |
| Symbolic Link | A shortcut or reference to another file or directory. | `l`           | 
| Special File  | Used for device access (e.g., block or character devices). | `b/c`         | 
| Socket File   | A special file for inter-process communication. | `s`           | 
| Named Pipe    | A file for data transfer between processes.   | `p`           | 

- Example: Checking File Types
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
  Output example:
  ```
  -rw-r--r--  1 user user 1024 Oct 19 10:00 file.txt
  drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Oct 19 10:00 Documents
  ```

### 1. Navigating Directories

- **`cd`**: Change directory.
  ```bash
  cd path/to/directory   # Go to a specific directory
  cd ..                   # Move up one level (parent directory)
  cd ~                    # Go to home directory
  cd -                    # Go back to the previous directory
  ```
Example

Our current location is `USER` folder
```bash
 cd DOWNLOAD/FILES    # Go to FILES folder
 cd ..                # Move up from FILES folder to DOWNLOAD
 cd -                 # Move up from DOWNLOAD to USER
 cd ~                 # Go to home directory
```
> [!NOTE]
> Each `..` represents moving up one level in the directory hierarchy, if the current directory is `/home/user/documents`, executing `cd ..` will change the directory to `/home/user`.

- **`pwd`**: Display the current working directory.
  
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
Example

If we run the `pwd` in the `FILES` folder
```
/home/USER/DOWNLOAD/FILES
```

  
### 1. Creating Files and Directories
- **`touch`**: Create an empty file.
  
  ```bash
  touch filename.txt
  ```
  
Example

Create file1 in FILES (current location)
  ```
  touch file1.txt
  ```
- **`mkdir`**: Create a new directory.
  
  ```bash
  mkdir new_directory       # Create a directory
  ```
  Example:
  Create folder in `DOWNLOAD` (current location)
  
  ```bash
  mkdir IMAGE          # Create a directory called "IMAGE"
  ```
  
  `Absolute Path`: A complete path starting from the root (/).
 ```bash
 /home/USER/DOWNLOAD/FILES/file2.txt
```

  `Relative Path`: A path relative to the current working directory. 
```bash
 FILES/PROJECTS (from DOWNLOAD to PROJECTS).
```


### 2. Listing Files and Directories
- **`ls`**: List files and directories in the current location.
  
  ```bash
  ls       # Basic listing
  ls -l    # Detailed view 
  ls -a    # Include hidden files
  ```
  Example:
  
If we run the `ls` in the `FILES` folder
```
file1.txt   file2.txt   file3.txt  PROJECTS          
```
 - **`stat`** command provides detailed information about a file, such as its size, permissions, ownership, and timestamps.
   ```bash
    stat filename
    ```
   Output example:
   ```bash
     File: file.txt
     Size: 1024       Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096 regular empty file
   Device: 802h/2050d   Inode: 131073     Links: 1
   Access: 2025-10-19 10:00:00.000000000 +0000
   Modify: 2025-10-19 09:59:00.000000000 +0000
   Change: 2025-10-19 09:59:10.000000000 +0000
    ```
**Fields in `stat` Output**
- `Size`: The size of the file in bytes.
- `Blocks`: The number of blocks allocated for the file.
- `Links`: Number of hard links pointing to the file.
- `Access`: Last time the file was read.
- `Modify`: Last time the file content was modified.
- `Change`: Last time metadata (e.g., permissions) was changed.


### 3. Copying Files and Directories
- **`cp`**: Copy files or directories.
  
  ```bash
  cp file1.txt file2.txt   # Copy a file
  cp -r dir1/ dir2/        # Copy a directory
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  cp -r my_documents /home/USER/BACKUPS/
  ```
> [!NOTE]
> This command copies the my_documents directory and all its contents into the `BACKUPS` directory within `/home/USER/`. 

### 4. Moving and Renaming Files
- **`mv`**: Move or rename files and directories.
  
  ```bash
  mv file.txt /path/to/destination/   # Move a file
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt          # Rename a file
  mv directory/ /path/to/destination/ # Move a directory
  ```
  Example:
  Our location is the `FILES` directory
  ```bash
  mv file1.txt report.txt      # Rename "file1.txt" to "report.txt"
  mv report.txt  PROJECTS/     # Move "report.txt" to inside the  "PROJECTS" directory
  ```

### 5. Deleting Files and Directories
- **`rm`**: Remove files or directories.
  
  ```bash
  rm file.txt             # Delete a file
  rm -r directory/        # Delete a directory and its contents
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  rm -rf unwanted_folder/   # Force delete a directory without prompts
  ```


### 6. Searching for Files
- **`find`**: Search for files and directories based on their name or other criteria.
  
  ```bash
  find /path -name "filename"   # Find a file with a specific name within the given path
  find /path -type d            # List only directories in the given path
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  find /home -name "*.txt"      # Find all .txt files in /home directory
  ```

### 7. Soft Links and Hard Links

Links in Linux allow you to reference or share files without duplicating them. There are two types of links: **soft links (symbolic)** and **hard links**.

### **1. Soft Links (Symbolic Links)**
- A **soft link** is like a shortcut to another file or directory.
- If the target file is deleted, the soft link becomes **broken**.

#### **Creating a Soft Link**
```bash
ln -s /path/to/target link_name
```

#### **Example**
```bash
ln -s /home/user/file.txt shortcut.txt
ls -l
```
Output:
```bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user 12 Oct 19 10:30 shortcut.txt -> /home/user/file.txt
```

### **2. Hard Links**
- A **hard link** is a direct reference to the same inode as the target file.
- If the original file is deleted, the hard link still works because it shares the same data on disk.
- Hard links **cannot** reference directories or files across different file systems.

#### **Creating a Hard Link**
```bash
ln /path/to/file link_name
```

#### **Example**
```bash
ln file.txt link_to_file.txt
ls -l
```
Output:
```plaintext
-rw-r--r-- 2 user user 1024 Oct 19 10:00 file.txt
-rw-r--r-- 2 user user 1024 Oct 19 10:00 link_to_file.txt
```

> The "Links" column in the output (`2`) shows that both files share the same inode.
