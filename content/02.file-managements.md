# File Management

Managing files and directories is a fundamental skill when working with Ubuntu Linux. Below is a concise list of commonly used file management commands to help you navigate, organize, and manipulate files and directories.

Before diving into the commands, itâ€™s important to understand what a directory is. A directory is a container used to organize and store files or other directories (called subdirectories).

You can think of it like a folder in a filing system, where files act as documents stored within these folders for better organization.

### 1. Creating Files and Directories
- **`touch`**: Create an empty file.
  ```bash
  touch filename.txt
  ```
- **`mkdir`**: Create a new directory.
  ```bash
  mkdir new_directory       # Create a directory
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  mkdir projects          # Create a directory called "projects"
  mkdir work/tasks       # Create "work" directory with a subdirectory "tasks"
  ```


### 2. Listing Files and Directories
- **`ls`**: List files and directories in the current location.
  ```bash
  ls       # Basic listing
  ls -l    # Detailed view 
  ls -a    # Include hidden files
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  ls   # the expected output-> Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Videos  
  ```

### 3. Navigating Directories
- **`cd`**: Change directory.
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory   # Go to a specific directory
  cd ..                   # Move up one level (parent directory)
  cd ~                    # Go to home directory
  cd -                    # Go back to the previous directory
  ```
  > path is the location of a file or directory in the file system. It tells the operating system how to locate a specific file or folder.
  
  > Each `..` represents moving up one level in the directory hierarchy, if the current directory is /home/user/documents, executing cd .. will change the directory to /home/user.
  
- **`pwd`**: Display the current working directory.
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```


### 4. Copying Files and Directories
- **`cp`**: Copy files or directories.
  ```bash
  cp file1.txt file2.txt   # Copy a file
  cp -r dir1/ dir2/        # Copy a directory
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  cp -r my_documents /home/user/backups/
  ```
  >This command copies the my_documents directory and all its contents into the backups directory within /home/user/. 

### 5. Moving and Renaming Files
- **`mv`**: Move or rename files and directories.
  ```bash
  mv file.txt /path/to/destination/   # Move a file
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt          # Rename a file
  mv directory/ /path/to/destination/ # Move a directory
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  mv myfile.txt documents/            # Move "myfile.txt" to the "documents" directory
  mv report.txt final_report.txt      # Rename "report.txt" to "final_report.txt"
  ```

### 6. Deleting Files and Directories
- **`rm`**: Remove files or directories.
  ```bash
  rm file.txt             # Delete a file
  rm -r directory/        # Delete a directory and its contents
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  rm -rf unwanted_folder/   # Force delete a directory without prompts
  ```

### 7. Viewing File Content
- **`cat`**: Display the contents of a file.
  ```bash
  cat file.txt
  ```
- **`less`**: View file content one screen at a time (useful for large files).
  ```bash
  less file.txt
  ```
- **`head`**: Show the first 10 lines of a file.
  ```bash
  head file.txt
  ```
- **`tail`**: Show the last 10 lines of a file.
  ```bash
  tail file.txt
  ```

### 8. Searching for Files
- **`find`**: Search for files and directories based on their name or other criteria.
  ```bash
  find /path -name "filename"   # Find a file with a specific name
  find /path -type d            # List only directories
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  find /home -name "*.txt"      # Find all .txt files in /home directory
  ```
