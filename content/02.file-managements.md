# File Management

Managing files and directories is a fundamental skill when working with operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu Linux). Below is a concise list of commonly used file management commands to help you navigate, organize, and manipulate files and directories.

Before diving into the commands, itâ€™s important to understand what a directory is. A directory is a container used to organize and store files or other directories (called subdirectories).

You can think of it like a folder in a filing system, where files act as documents stored within these folders for better organization.

### 1. Navigating Directories

- **`pwd`**: Display the current working directory.
  
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
  Example:
  If we run the `pwd` in the user folder which is here `noura`
  ```
  pwd
  /home/noura
  ```
  - **`cd`**: Change directory.

  ```bash
  cd path/to/directory   # Go to a specific directory
  cd ..                   # Move up one level (parent directory)
  cd ~                    # Go to home directory
  cd -                    # Go back to the previous directory
  
  ```
  Example
  ```bash
   pwd
   /home/noura                 # Output of pwd in the 'noura' directory
   cd Documents                # Go to the Documents folder
   pwd
   /home/noura/Documents       # Output
   cd ..                       # Move up from Documents folder to noura
   pwd
   /home/noura                 # Output
   cd -                        # Return to the previous directory (Documents)
   pwd
  /home/noura/Documents       # Output
  ```
> [!NOTE]
> Each `..` represents moving up one level in the directory hierarchy.

  
### 2. Creating Files and Directories

- **`mkdir`**: Create a new directory.
  
  ```bash
  mkdir directory_name       # Create a directory
  ```
  
  Example:
  
  Create a directory in `Documents` (current location)
  
  ```bash
  cd /home/noura/Documents
  mkdir Image               # Create a directory called "Image"
  ```
- **`touch`**: Create an empty file.
  
  ```bash
  touch filename.txt
  ```
  
  Example:

  Create file2 in Image (current location)
   ```
   cd Image         # Enter the Image directory
   touch file2.txt  # Create an empty file
   ```

  ### Paths
  `Absolute Path`: A complete path starting from the root (/).
   ```bash
   /home/noura/Documents/Image
  ```

  `Relative Path`: A path relative to the current working directory (we are in /home/noura/Documents
  ```bash
  Image/file2.txt 
  ```


### 3. Listing Files and Directories

Linux supports various file types. You can identify the type of a file using the `ls -l` command, where **the first character of the file permissions indicates the file type**.

| **File Type** | **Description**                              | **Indicator** |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Regular File  | A standard file containing data (text, binary, etc.). | `- `
| Directory     | A folder containing other files or directories. | `d`       |
| Symbolic Link | A shortcut or reference to another file or directory. | `l`           | 
| Special File  | Used for device access (e.g., block or character devices). | `b/c`         | 
| Socket File   | A special file for inter-process communication. | `s`           | 
| Named Pipe    | A file for data transfer between processes.   | `p`           | 

- Example: Checking File Types
  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
  Output example:
  ```
  -rw-r--r--  1 user user 1024 Oct 19 10:00 file.txt
  drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Oct 19 10:00 Documents
  ```
- **`ls`**: List files and directories in the current location.
  
  ```bash
  ls       # Basic listing
  ls -l    # Detailed view 
  ls -a    # Include hidden files
  ```

- **`stat`**: Get detailed information about a file.
   ```bash
    stat filename
    ```
  
  Example:
   
  1. Listing files in the `Image` directory:
   ```
   cd /home/noura/Documents/Image
   ls                              # Output is file2.txt
  ```
   2.Using `stat` to get file information:
  
    ```
    stat file2.txt
    ```

   ```bash
     File: file2.txt
     Size: 1024       Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096 regular empty file
   Device: 802h/2050d   Inode: 131073     Links: 1
   Access: 2025-10-19 10:00:00.000000000 +0000
   Modify: 2025-10-19 09:59:00.000000000 +0000
   Change: 2025-10-19 09:59:10.000000000 +0000
    ```
**Fields in `stat` Output**
   - `Size`: The size of the file in bytes.
   - `Blocks`: The number of blocks allocated for the file.
   - `Links`: Number of hard links pointing to the file.
   - `Access`: Last time the file was read.
   - `Modify`: Last time the file content was modified.
   - `Change`: Last time metadata (e.g., permissions) was changed.


### 4. Copying Files and Directories
- **`cp`**: Copy files or directories.
  
  ```bash
  cp file2.txt file3.txt                             # Copy a file
  cp -r source_directory destination_directory       # Copy a directory
  ```
  Example:
  Copy `Image` directory to `Backup`:
  
  ```bash
  cp -r Documents/Image  Documents/Backup
  ```
  
> [!NOTE]
> This command recursively copies the Image directory and its contents into the Backup directory. If the Backup directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

### 5. Moving and Renaming Files
- **`mv`**: Move or rename files and directories.
  
  ```bash
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt          
  mv source destination
  ```
  Example:
  Rename `file2.txt` to `report.txt`:
  ```bash
   mv file2.txt report.txt  
  ```
  Move `report.txt` into `Image` directory:
  ```bash
  mv report.txt  Image/    
  ```

### 6. Deleting Files and Directories
- **`rm`**: Remove files or directories.
  
  ```bash
  rm file.txt             # Delete a file
  rm -r directoryname/        # Delete a directory and its contents
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  rm -rf unwanted_folder/   # Force delete a directory without prompts
  ```


### 7. Searching for Files
- **`find`**: Search for files and directories based on their name or other criteria.
  
  ```bash
  find /path -name "filename"   # Find a file with a specific name within the given path
  find /path -type d            # List only directories in the given path
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  find /home/noura/Documents -name "*.txt"      # Find all .txt files
  ```

### 8. Soft Links and Hard Links

#### **Soft Links (Symbolic Links)**
- A soft link is like a shortcut to another file or directory and if the target file is deleted, the soft link becomes broken.

#### **Creating a Soft Link**
```bash
ln -s /path/to/target link_name
```

Example:

```bash
ln -s /home/noura/Documents/Image shortcut
ls -l
```
Output:
```bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 noura noura 27 Oct 19 10:30 shortcut -> /home/noura/Documents/Image
```

#### **Hard Links**
- A hard link points to the same inode as the original file. If the original file is deleted, the hard link remains intact.
  
#### **Creating a Hard Link**
```bash
ln /path/to/file link_name
```

Example:
```bash
ln file.txt link_to_file.txt
ls -l
```
Output:
```plaintext
-rw-r--r-- 2 user user 1024 Oct 19 10:00 file.txt
-rw-r--r-- 2 user user 1024 Oct 19 10:00 link_to_file.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
>  The "Links" column in the output (`2`) shows that both files share the same inode.
